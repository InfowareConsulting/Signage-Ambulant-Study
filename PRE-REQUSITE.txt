README: 

       This document contains the steps followed to replicate the ambulant 
player on Ubuntu 14.04 Kyline version on 15th Feb 2015.

a) We can download ambulant-2.6.tar.gz from the website of ambulant download 
   site.  https://sourceforge.net/projects/ambulant/files/Ambulant%20Player%20Source/2.6/ambulant-2.6.tar.gz/download

b) We would have got ambulant-2.6.tar.gz just using the linux command extract
   tar -xvf ambulant-2.6.tar.gz into ambulant-2.6

c) Following packages are needed for Ambulant to build.
   so install one after the other.
   sudo apt-get install autoconf
   sudo apt-get install automake
   sudo apt-get install libtool
   sudo apt-get install gettext
   sudo apt-get install gcc++
   sudo apt-get install gtk2-devel
   sudo apt-get install qt-devel
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install g++-4.9

d) We now change the directory to following
   cd $HOME/ambulant-2.6/scripts

e) We now run a precheck-ubuntu.sh in the folder of scripts, this should give
   no error log.

f) We now see the error in the log so some stuff are still not present.
   so we install the following.
   sudo apt-get install qt
   sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev
   sudo apt-get install build-essential
   sudo apt-get install libgu1-mesa-dev -y
   sudo apt-get install xml2-config
   
g) We now verify if we can build Ambulant Player with the command
   sudo python ../scripts/build-third-party-packages.py linux
   
h) We might get few more issues so we need to install 
   so we install the following.
   sudo apt-get install qt3-devel
   sudo apt-get install qt5-devel
   sudo apt-get install gtk2-devel
   sudo apt-get install libgtk-2-dev
   sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev
   sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev

i) We now run ./configure from ambulant-2.6 and then call the following
   make
   sudo make install

j) We would get the Ambulant Player compiled and built and it will be
   installed in /usr/local/bin

k) We can run the the AmbulantPlayer & (run in background) to start 
   populating the SMIL- Signage Player on Linux OS.
